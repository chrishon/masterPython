--> 00:05.080\\\\nI\\'m now going to give you two more example problems of computing.\\\\n\\\\n1\\\\n00:05.080 --> 00:09.310\\\\neigendecomposition of matrices by hand.\\\\n\\\\n2\\\\n00:09.310 --> 00:14.860\\\\nObviously this is on the computer but I encourage you to do these problems by hand and they\\'re not done\\\\n\\\\n3\\\\n00:14.860 --> 00:15.520\\\\nin Matlab.\\\\n\\\\n4\\\\n00:15.520 --> 00:19.270\\\\nSo I guess that\\'s what it means by hand.\\\\n\\\\n5\\\\n00:19.270 --> 00:20.530\\\\nSo let\\'s get started.\\\\n\\\\n6\\\\n00:20.560 --> 00:28.030\\\\nHere is a two by two matrix and you should pause the video go through find the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors\\\\n\\\\n7\\\\n00:28.060 --> 00:37.120\\\\nof this matrix so the way we start is by shifting the matrix by Lambda so subtracting lambda from the\\\\n\\\\n8\\\\n00:37.120 --> 00:44.260\\\\ndiagonal elements setting the determinant equal to zero and then proceeding to compute the determinant\\\\n\\\\n9\\\\n00:44.290 --> 00:48.820\\\\nwhich is also called the characteristic equation of this matrix.\\\\n\\\\n10\\\\n00:48.850 --> 00:57.730\\\\nSo that works out to be three minus lambda times six minus lambda minus four equals zero and then expanding\\\\n\\\\n11\\\\n00:57.760 --> 01:04.600\\\\nthese two terms multiplying out these two terms and then collecting the like terms gives us lambda squared\\\\n\\\\n12\\\\n01:04.960 --> 01:13.930\\\\nminus nine lambda plus fourteen equals zero and then this expression here can be factored into lambda\\\\n\\\\n13\\\\n01:14.020 --> 01:22.150\\\\nminus seven and Lambda minus two and now it\\'s pretty easy to see that the two lambdas that will solve\\\\n\\\\n14\\\\n01:22.150 --> 01:24.280\\\\nthis equation that solve this equation.\\\\n\\\\n15\\\\n01:24.280 --> 01:30.910\\\\nIn other words the two eigenvalues of this matrix are plus 7 and plus two.\\\\n\\\\n16\\\\n01:30.910 --> 01:37.180\\\\nSo that was step one we found the eigenvalues of this matrix and now we go through for each of these\\\\n\\\\n17\\\\n01:37.180 --> 01:45.160\\\\neigenvalues shift the matrix by that amount by that value and then figure out what is a vector in the\\\\n\\\\n18\\\\n01:45.280 --> 01:48.410\\\\nshifted matrices null space.\\\\n\\\\n19\\\\n01:48.630 --> 01:50.530\\\\nOK so let\\'s start with 2.\\\\n\\\\n20\\\\n01:50.580 --> 01:53.610\\\\nSo this gives us the matrix 1 1 4 4.\\\\n\\\\n21\\\\n01:53.610 --> 02:00.360\\\\nAnd now we want to find the missing vector here and you\\'ve probably guessed it already it is 1 minus\\\\n\\\\n22\\\\n02:00.360 --> 02:01.470\\\\n1.\\\\n\\\\n23\\\\n02:01.590 --> 02:09.330\\\\nAnd of course you know that also acceptable would be minus 1 1 or minus quadrillion plus quadrillion.\\\\n\\\\n24\\\\n02:09.570 --> 02:17.130\\\\nThis vector simply identifies a subspace for the null space of this shifted matrix in any vector that\\'s\\\\n\\\\n25\\\\n02:17.250 --> 02:23.520\\\\nin that null space is perfectly fine as an eigenvector.\\\\n\\\\n26\\\\n02:23.520 --> 02:31.860\\\\nNow that said the best choice for an eigenvector would be a vector that has a norm of 1 a magnitude\\\\n\\\\n27\\\\n02:31.860 --> 02:32.710\\\\nof 1.\\\\n\\\\n28\\\\n02:32.940 --> 02:39.270\\\\nAnd the second best choice would be integer values that are easy to interpret and compact to write like\\\\n\\\\n29\\\\n02:39.270 --> 02:40.230\\\\nthis.\\\\n\\\\n30\\\\n02:40.230 --> 02:40.500\\\\nAll right.\\\\n\\\\n31\\\\n02:40.520 --> 02:41.730\\\\nSo this was for two.\\\\n\\\\n32\\\\n02:41.730 --> 02:49.350\\\\nNow we go to the second eigenvalues which was seven and that gives us this matrix minus 4 1 and 4 minus\\\\n\\\\n33\\\\n02:49.350 --> 02:50.300\\\\n1.\\\\n\\\\n34\\\\n02:50.370 --> 02:57.210\\\\nAnd here a vector that could work as an eigenvector as a basis for the null space of this shifted matrix\\\\n\\\\n35\\\\n02:57.300 --> 02:59.790\\\\nis the numbers 1 4.\\\\n\\\\n36\\\\n02:59.820 --> 03:06.690\\\\nSo here is the big picture overview we have this matrix and here you see the eigenvalue and its corresponding\\\\n\\\\n37\\\\n03:06.690 --> 03:12.010\\\\neigenvector and the other eigenvalue and the other corresponding eigenvector.\\\\n\\\\n38\\\\n03:12.060 --> 03:14.080\\\\nNow your results will be correct.\\\\n\\\\n39\\\\n03:14.190 --> 03:21.960\\\\nIf you have the correct pairing of eigenvalue and any multiple any scaled version of this vector; it\\\\n\\\\n40\\\\n03:21.960 --> 03:28.860\\\\ndoesn\\'t matter if you call this lambda one and this V one that\\'s fine because there\\'s no intrinsic ordering.\\\\n\\\\n41\\\\n03:28.860 --> 03:32.250\\\\nWhat matters is that you have the pairing correct.\\\\n\\\\n42\\\\n03:32.250 --> 03:32.470\\\\nAll right.\\\\n\\\\n43\\\\n03:32.490 --> 03:34.310\\\\nSo that was the two by two case.\\\\n\\\\n44\\\\n03:34.380 --> 03:37.080\\\\nNow let\\'s go for a three by three case.\\\\n\\\\n45\\\\n03:37.080 --> 03:40.160\\\\nThis one is a little bit more challenging and I have to admit.\\\\n\\\\n46\\\\n03:40.200 --> 03:45.660\\\\nSo I first came up with these numbers and then I started computing the eigendecomposition.\\\\n\\\\n47\\\\n03:45.660 --> 03:50.480\\\\nNow I have to admit that I got stuck on one of the eigenvectors.\\\\n\\\\n48\\\\n03:50.670 --> 03:52.400\\\\nI couldn\\'t quite figure it out on my own.\\\\n\\\\n49\\\\n03:52.430 --> 03:54.390\\\\nSo I used Matlab to compute that\\\\n\\\\n50\\\\n03:54.390 --> 03:55.200\\\\neigenvector.\\\\n\\\\n51\\\\n03:55.500 --> 04:04.490\\\\nSo what I encourage you to do is find all three eigenvalues by hand and I think it will be pretty obvious\\\\n\\\\n52\\\\n04:04.490 --> 04:08.390\\\\nwhen you start working through it which is the difficult eigenvalue.\\\\n\\\\n53\\\\n04:08.390 --> 04:15.530\\\\nSo then what you should do by hand is find two of the eigenvectors that you can get basically just by\\\\n\\\\n54\\\\n04:15.800 --> 04:18.920\\\\nkind of eyeballing and making some educated guesses.\\\\n\\\\n55\\\\n04:18.920 --> 04:24.860\\\\nAnd then the third eigenvector you can use a computer to solve or you can just wait and watch me come\\\\n\\\\n56\\\\n04:24.860 --> 04:26.660\\\\nup with a solution.\\\\n\\\\n57\\\\n04:26.850 --> 04:27.090\\\\nAll right.\\\\n\\\\n58\\\\n04:27.120 --> 04:34.590\\\\nSo again we start by shifting this matrix by minus lambda setting the determinant equal to zero and\\\\n\\\\n59\\\\n04:34.590 --> 04:40.770\\\\nthen proceeding to compute the determinant of this equation and altogether that gives us the characteristic\\\\n\\\\n60\\\\n04:40.830 --> 04:43.560\\\\nequation of this matrix.\\\\n\\\\n61\\\\n04:43.560 --> 04:45.270\\\\nNow this is a little bit longer.\\\\n\\\\n62\\\\n04:45.270 --> 04:50.820\\\\nIt\\'s a little bit trickier the arithmetic gets a little bit hairy in particular you end up with this\\\\n\\\\n63\\\\n04:50.910 --> 04:59.240\\\\nminus lambda cubed term as well as a couple of multiple terms with Lambda and Lambda squared.\\\\n\\\\n64\\\\n04:59.250 --> 05:05.490\\\\nNow once you collect all of these like terms you\\'ll end up with an expression that looks like this.\\\\n\\\\n65\\\\n05:05.520 --> 05:15.240\\\\nSo it should be minus lambda cubed plus 10 times lambda squared plus eleven lambda equals zero Now something\\\\n\\\\n66\\\\n05:15.270 --> 05:22.030\\\\ninteresting has happened here all of these terms have a lambda attached to them which means that we\\\\n\\\\n67\\\\n05:22.030 --> 05:29.950\\\\ncan take a lambda out of each of these terms and rewrite this expression as minus lambda times.\\\\n\\\\n68\\\\n05:29.980 --> 05:36.160\\\\nAll of this stuff and immediately that tells us that lambda equals zero is a solution.\\\\n\\\\n69\\\\n05:36.160 --> 05:43.030\\\\nSo when you set this lambda to be zero it doesn\\'t actually matter what\\'s inside this parenthetical statement\\\\n\\\\n70\\\\n05:43.360 --> 05:47.390\\\\nthat\\'s immediately going to set to make this equation true.\\\\n\\\\n71\\\\n05:47.440 --> 05:55.300\\\\nThat means that one of the eigenvalues of this matrix is zero and I\\'m going to have an entire video\\\\n\\\\n72\\\\n05:55.330 --> 05:59.140\\\\njust about this phenomenon a little bit later in this section.\\\\n\\\\n73\\\\n05:59.140 --> 06:03.550\\\\nBut essentially when an eigenvector is an eigenvalue is zero.\\\\n\\\\n74\\\\n06:03.730 --> 06:10.360\\\\nIt means that the matrix is singular and that you can actually see by looking at this matrix and you\\\\n\\\\n75\\\\n06:10.360 --> 06:19.080\\\\nsee that column 1 plus column 2 equals column 3 so whenever you have a singular matrix at least one\\\\n\\\\n76\\\\n06:19.140 --> 06:22.110\\\\neigenvalues value is going to be equal to zero.\\\\n\\\\n77\\\\n06:22.170 --> 06:30.450\\\\nAnd in fact the number of eigenvalues that are equal to zero tells you about the rank of this matrix.\\\\n\\\\n78\\\\n06:30.490 --> 06:33.870\\\\nMore on that in the later video.\\\\n\\\\n79\\\\n06:33.880 --> 06:39.160\\\\nNow once you\\'ve gotten to this step you can further factor this equation and you end up with the result\\\\n\\\\n80\\\\n06:39.160 --> 06:44.360\\\\nthat lambda equals zero lambda equals minus 1 and Lambda equals eleven.\\\\n\\\\n81\\\\n06:44.590 --> 06:50.110\\\\nSo you can probably guess that this is going to be the tricky I can value to compute the corresponding\\\\n\\\\n82\\\\n06:50.110 --> 06:55.600\\\\nI can vector of and this is the one that I got a little bit stuck with.\\\\n\\\\n83\\\\n06:55.600 --> 06:57.490\\\\nAnd so I used Matlab as a crutch.\\\\n\\\\n84\\\\n06:57.490 --> 06:58.540\\\\nI cheated a little bit.\\\\n\\\\n85\\\\n06:59.250 --> 07:01.500\\\\nOK so but let\\'s go through all of these.\\\\n\\\\n86\\\\n07:01.840 --> 07:07.840\\\\nSo we start with zero and now this is kind of a funny thing because we are shifting the matrix by zero\\\\n\\\\n87\\\\n07:08.200 --> 07:10.970\\\\nwhich actually means we\\'re not changing the matrix at all.\\\\n\\\\n88\\\\n07:11.140 --> 07:21.000\\\\nAnd that means that this matrix A already has a non-trivial null space even without doing any shifting.\\\\n\\\\n89\\\\n07:21.130 --> 07:28.010\\\\nSo this problem actually boils down to finding a vector in the null space or a basis for the null space.\\\\n\\\\n90\\\\n07:28.270 --> 07:35.380\\\\nEven without doing any shifting so based on what I just told you about how do I set up this matrix that\\\\n\\\\n91\\\\n07:35.660 --> 07:42.950\\\\ncolumn one plus column two equals column three a basis for the null space is 1 one minus 1.\\\\n\\\\n92\\\\n07:42.970 --> 07:49.130\\\\nSo you can try for each of these rows the first column plus the second column minus the third column\\\\n\\\\n93\\\\n07:49.220 --> 07:52.090\\\\nequals zero all right.\\\\n\\\\n94\\\\n07:52.100 --> 07:53.270\\\\nSo now let\\'s move on.\\\\n\\\\n95\\\\n07:53.270 --> 07:59.350\\\\nSo now we shift this matrix by eleven and this is basically where I got stuck and switch to matlab.\\\\n\\\\n96\\\\n07:59.360 --> 08:04.570\\\\nSo it turns out that eigenvector is nineteen forty one and thirty six.\\\\n\\\\n97\\\\n08:04.580 --> 08:10.430\\\\nSo if you figured out this I can vector on your own without using a computer then good for you you are\\\\n\\\\n98\\\\n08:10.460 --> 08:14.960\\\\na better or at least more patient mathematician than I am.\\\\n\\\\n99\\\\n08:15.200 --> 08:19.210\\\\nAnd then we get to the third eigenvalue which was minus one.\\\\n\\\\n100\\\\n08:19.220 --> 08:21.130\\\\nSo now that becomes plus one.\\\\n\\\\n101\\\\n08:21.230 --> 08:26.390\\\\nAnd here is that shifted matrix and this one you should be able to solve on your own.\\\\n\\\\n102\\\\n08:26.480 --> 08:28.810\\\\nIn fact it\\'s even easier than it looks.\\\\n\\\\n103\\\\n08:28.820 --> 08:35.930\\\\nAnd if you need a hint before I show the answer then the hint is just consider that this third column\\\\n\\\\n104\\\\n08:36.020 --> 08:42.340\\\\nis actually pretty useless if you get rid of this third column it becomes really easy to find the \\\\n\\\\n105\\\\n08:42.380 --> 08:46.520\\\\neigenvector in this shifted matrices null space.\\\\n\\\\n106\\\\n08:46.790 --> 08:52.400\\\\nSo in fact it\\'s one minus one and then zero you just set the third element to be zero.\\\\n\\\\n107\\\\n08:52.670 --> 08:59.810\\\\nSo that leads us to the big picture overview of the eigendecomposition of this three by three singular\\\\n\\\\n108\\\\n08:59.810 --> 09:06.130\\\\nmatrix rank 2 matrix we have eigenvalues 0 minus 11 and minus 1.\\\\n\\\\n109\\\\n09:06.200 --> 09:09.200\\\\nAnd these are the corresponding eigenvectors.\\\\n\\\\n110\\\\n09:09.200 --> 09:12.430\\\\nAnd notice I\\'ve written them as row vectors and then transpose.\\\\n\\\\n111\\\\n09:12.430 --> 09:19.160\\\\nSo these are still column vectors we generally always think about eigenvectors as column vectors and\\\\n\\\\n112\\\\n09:19.160 --> 09:25.640\\\\nyou will learn more about why that is the case in the video on diagonalization, which is coming up soon.\"'"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":9}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"c21_-TiZCOMd","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1635696184924,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":222,"user":{"displayName":"Chrishon
